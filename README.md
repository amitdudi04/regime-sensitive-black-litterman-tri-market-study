# Regime-Sensitive Black–Litterman Tri-Market Portfolio Allocation Study

**Author:** Amit Kumar Dudi  
**Date:** March 2026

## Project Overview
This repository hosts a professional quantitative research pipeline investigating the out-of-sample stability of the Black-Litterman Bayesian allocation framework operating across the United States, China, and India markets. Built for explicit academic reproducibility, the system architecture completely decouples theoretical mathematical models from chronological data manipulation, frictional simulations, and structural statistical validations.

## Research Motivation
Classical unconstrained mean-variance optimization models frequently exhibit severe structural vulnerability out-of-sample due to inherent estimation error maximization and instability during macroeconomic regime transitions. This research system computationally refines and implements a transaction-cost-aware Bayesian asset allocation strategy mapping specifically to emerging markets, further incorporating an isolated empirical sub-study evaluating Chinese State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) versus Private entities during deep systemic crises.

## Methodology Overview
To bypass forward-looking estimation bias, out-of-sample execution operates strictly utilizing continuous 252-day expanding windows. Mathematical matrices integrate Ledoit-Wolf shrinkage to resolve sample covariance singularity. Unpenalized dynamic allocation decay is evaluated explicitly utilizing an $L_1$-norm **Allocation Stability Index (ASI)**. The statistical engine natively bounds performance distributions internally utilizing Circular Block Bootstrapped confidence testing alongside decoupled Markov Regime Detection arrays.

## Execution Instructions
Before initiating the pipelines, ensure all environmental dependencies are strictly met utilizing Python 3.10+.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To fully regenerate the baseline Tri-Market optimization bounds and empirical regime evaluations:
```bash
python pipelines/run_tri_market_pipeline.py
```

To reconstruct the explicit mathematical boundaries of the Bayesian scalar across independent validation runs:
```bash
python experiments/run_tau_sensitivity.py
```

## Key Results Summary
* **Bayesian Stabilization**: The Black-Litterman optimization demonstrated statistically significant advantages regarding structural turnover mitigation and out-of-sample absolute drawdown compression compared to the baseline Mean-Variance unconstrained framework.
* **Structural Ownership Insulation**: The empirical sub-study isolated during the 2015 Chinese liquidity contraction definitively rejected institutional heuristics; Chinese SOEs structurally failed to supply asymmetric downside isolation comparatively against their Private cohort.
* **Regime Conditional Superiority**: Conditional variance modeling mapped via two-state Markov Switching verified Black-Litterman’s isolated outperformance structurally compounded primarily underneath deep high-volatility systemic regimes.
* **Fama-French Validation**: True predictive Alpha generation was isolated and structurally confirmed disjoint of latent implicit systematic size/value momentum constraints.

## Visualization Examples
Upon pipeline execution, continuous statistical distributions render natively into `visualization/`:
- `rolling_sharpe.png`: A continuous 252-day lagging stability evaluation.
- `drawdown_comparison.png`: Absolute peak-to-trough systemic loss contours.
- `asi_stability.png`: Aggregated daily $L_1$-norm allocation shifts.
- `tau_sensitivity.png`: Granular Bayesian scalar elasticity measurements.
- `regime_probabilities.png`: Filtered and smoothed Markov market states.
- `regime_performance_comparison.png`: A segmented cross-sectional structural Sharpe analysis.

## Reproducibility Instructions
To universally recreate the documentation tables, raw statistics, and empirical conclusions highlighted within the *Final Research Results Compendium*, identically execute the primary configuration (`config/project_config.yaml`). The framework’s decoupled internal memory guarantees 100% deterministic outputs across identical CPU footprints sequentially executing `run_tri_market_pipeline.py`.
